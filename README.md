💡 Over the holidays, I built Sous Chef, an AI-based agent to simplify my family’s meal prep. 🍳

Using the Agno 's (formely know as Phidata) Agentic Framework, I built an agent tailored to my family’s needs. Phidata’s examples gave me a solid starting point, but I needed something more specific. Here’s what I prioritized:

1️⃣ Customized Recipe Search: I used the tools in phidata to pull recipes from trusted websites and the wider internet. 
2️⃣ Ingredient Lists Are Non-Negotiable: Complete, exhaustive lists were a must to avoid surprises like running out of baking soda mid-bake! 
3️⃣ Email Delivery: Instead of a chat interface, I wanted recipes sent directly to my inbox—a simple way to share with my husband.

Key Learnings:
* Craft Clear Prompts: Be specific. Adding “be exhaustive” to my agent’s instructions drastically improved ingredient extraction.
* Respect Websites: Avoid overwhelming sites with unnecessary API calls. Play nice.
* Use AI Where It Matters: Let AI handle high-impact tasks, but don’t overcomplicate the basics. For example, I didn’t use an LLM to send the final email—classic solutions work just fine.
* Leverage Co-Pilots: Tools like Cursor were a game-changer for me. They simplified unfamiliar steps—like automating emails—and helped me move quickly on this project. I think of them as my modern-day calculator: indispensable and always worth leaning on when I need a boost.
* Prototype First: Start small, test, and iterate.
This was a fun and dare I say a delicious way to explore how AI can streamline everyday tasks. I use Sous Chef almost everyday and planning to refine it further by adding offline family recipes!
